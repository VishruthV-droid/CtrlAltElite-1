<p style="color:white">Many people don't have awareness of their daily actions. To make them aware of the causes of their simple actions that are affecting the environment, we made a carbon footprint calculator which estimates how much carbon the person releases per day.</p>
<p style="color:white">You can stop the carbon pollution by following these steps:<br> 1. learn the 5 R's: refuse, reduce, reuse, rot, recycle: Going zero waste is a great step towards combating climate change<br>
2.bike more and drive less<br>
3.conserve water and protect our waterways<br>
4.eat seasonally, locally, and more plants<br>
5.switch to sustainable, clean energy</p>
